File Transfer Client or FT-Client for short is a FTP Client for downloading, deleting and uploading files to a FTP Server. 

My main goal for this project was to combine the JFileChooser component from swing with apache's FTPClient to show files 
and folders that sit on the server in a JComponent. I also tried to keep everything tidy and modular for future changes or enhancements.
